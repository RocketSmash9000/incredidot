# Incredidot
An open source "tool" that aims for an easier experience during Incredibox mod development, as it removes most of the unnecesary work. With this tool you may now only need to add the polo sounds, designs and animations and UI elements. No need to code or type anything hard to understand.

## Cloning the project
You can choose one of these options

### Git command (Windows)
You will need to have Git installed.
 1. Open cmd or PowerShell in the folder you want the project cloned into. The folder should be empty.
 2. Type `git clone https://github.com/RocketSmash9000/incredidot.git` into the terminal of your choice and hit enter.

### Git command (Linux)
You need Git (though most distros already have it installed)

 2. Type `git clone https://github.com/RocketSmash9000/incredidot.git` and hit enter.

### Download from GitHub
 1. Click the green button at the top of the page that says "Code".
 2. Click on "Download ZIP"
 3. Unzip the downloaded file into the desired folder

### Use the GitHub app
You will (*obviously*) need the GitHub app
 1. Add a new repository
 2. Click on "Clone repository..."
 3. Select "URL"
 4. Paste `https://github.com/RocketSmash9000/incredidot.git` into the URL textbar
 5. Select the folder you want the repository to be in

## Contribute
Of course you can! I want to improve this project to its best state, so if you'd like to help, feel free to clone the project and suggest/add changes

## Need help?
First look for issues related to your problem. If that didn't resolve your issue, feel free to open an issue with a detailed description of your problem.

## Do you want/need to change the code?
Since the project is open source and modular, there are many things you can do to adapt it to your needs. For example, you may want to add 30 polo sounds instead of the usual 20 for some big mod you're creating. In those cases, I reccommend that you please refer to the documentation in the wiki tab, or read the comments in the code.

If you run into any issues, feel free to Google your problems, DM me in Discord, or open an issue in this project with the "derived" tag.

## Other
